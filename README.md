    <h2 align="center">Intract</h2>
    <h5 align = "center">Ever bored during online classes causing you to not understand as a student? <br>Ever came across a situation where you couldnt judge the mood of the class as the faculty?<br/>Intract helps you to accurately detect the emotion of the students to gauge their level of involvement and interaction.

</p>

### Our Inspiration
Recently, we were conducting basics of coding session for the juniors of our university.<br/> 
During that, we were'nt able to gauge whether they were able to follow, whether they are clear on the concepts<br/> 
or atleast if they were present in the class. Teachers must face this on a daily basis.<br/> 
This is a small effort to make their lives easier for all that they do for us!

### What it Does
Our website is able to accurately detect the emotion of the students to gauge their level of involvement and interaction.<br/> 
This data is then compiled and is made visible to the teacher so that he can monitor the involvement of the class and <br/>
ensure maximum retention by the students.
